- Values in javascript have observable behaviour based on the operation .
- Behaviour depends on the type of the valye (eg: callable or properties).
- Errors (eg type error) occurs when the operations mismatch the value type.
- Javascript uses dynamic typing (errors appears at the run time).
- Typescript is used for the static typing , which predicts the errors before the runtime.
- Identifies errror (eg callables or non callable value) before running code .
- Helps catched bugs like typos , uncalled functions or logical errors.
- Typescript tooling enhances development with features like error detection , code complition , code fixes and navigation.
- We can install typescript using npm in our system . 
- File extention of typescript file is ts.
- We can compile ts file using tsc file.ts.
- We write code in the ts file , we can see the errors emmiting while writing then we can complile our ts file which tranform it into compatible javascript .
