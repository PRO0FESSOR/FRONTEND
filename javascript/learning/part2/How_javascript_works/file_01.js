//How js works and executes code is already in the one shot .

// First compilation is done - error checking and determining appropriate scope for variables .
// Global execution context is created where memory is assigned .
// Gec code execution executes code line by line .

console.log(name); // logs undefined 

var age =7 ; // assigned in the memory 

console.log(age); // age value from memory
